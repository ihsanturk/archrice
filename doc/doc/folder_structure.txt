                                                   5. "Better" folder structure:
                                                     What do I want from a folder structure?
                                                       o Easier
                                                       o Reusable
                                                       o Efficient
                                                       o Maintainable
                                                       o Easy to find (efficient for find programs)

                                                     Conflicts:
                                                       Which one of these is better?
                                                         a) Pack all related files in one folder
                                                         b) Put related files in their respective folders

                                                         Option "a" is more portable
                                                         Option "b" is more logical

                                                     Life Scenarios:
                                                       I want to find;
                                                         - main.cpp which is in folder that I am working on a project

                                                         - logo.blend which is in the folder named like youtube istebukadar
