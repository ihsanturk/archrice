Suprise.. Suprise! (25.05.2019)

I am thinking about switching OpenBSD from FreeBSD
I will push my out dated repos and download
OpenBSD fs file and install it

I will need to do these after installing:
	install dwm
	install st

Now I switched to MacOS Mojave-[Hackintosh] (2019.06.04)
Thoughts:
	- It's easy and beautiful.
	- I can use bitwarden and vim extensions with safari.
	- Brightness, shortcuts and anything else: Just Works.
			(Except: sound)
	- I can use garageband.
	- I can use Ableton.
	- I can use spitfire (VST Plugins).
	- I'm technically using a linux/unix machine and can use good apps with that.

Issues:
  - When suspend the machine, the sound (AppleALC.kext w/ Lilu.kext) does not works.
	    Maybe VoodooHDA.kext works ??? (edit: naaah, same)
	- Wifi not working (done: Bought a usb wifi card).
	- I must switch headphone/speaker manually :/
	    Maybe can create a shortcut or a deamon for that.
  - I can't use my BEAST(!) GTX 1050 Ti :/ (rendering in blender / ai training)


me again... (2019.06.19)
  I am currently using macOS Mojave but..
  I want to switch to void/arch/gentoo linux again
  Because:
    I want to use my lovely dwm and graphic card
    But:
      I was using iMovie and garageband (and Ableton Live with Spitfire Audio)
      I can use blender as a video editor in linux
      But:
        I don't think (or know) I will find a good DAW for spitfire VST plugin.
        Alright alright.. I will use my iPhone for playing piano. (Not that bad)
  Also:
    I should solve the problem with connecting my iphone to the linux machine
      with libimobiledevice (Lockdown? problem).


  Okay guys I decided to switch to arch A g a i n.
  Arch Benefits:
    + dwm
    + renders with graphic card in Blender
    + linux freedom

Hey guysssss it's me (2019.09.02)
After a while I decided to switch tooo... Debian!

I've missed tiling window managers (dwm), oh God!
I will install linux and will get rid of this (non-productive) macos
GoodBye Apple. :) 

I feel productive and comfy with linux.

But there will be some deficiencies:
  1. I can't use Canon EOS Utility in linux because they do not support.
  2. I can't use Quicktime in linux for reflecting iPhone screen to desktop
