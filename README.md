# Preview

## Basic

**Openbox Theme** : Arroundie (included in this repo). To get the rounded corner, You need *openbox-patched* (AUR). 
Or if You are on Debian, You can read [this](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=3173) discussion on BunsenLabs Forum to get it. <br />
**GTK Theme** : [Lumiere](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/gtk-theme-collections), **Panel** : tint2, 
**Running Apps** : Feh, Thunar, & vim inside termite <br />
**Now Playing** : Led Zeppelin - Since I Have Been Loving You <br /> <br />

## i3-gaps : Scenes From a Memory

**Stuff in the screenshot** : Ncmpcpp inside Urxvt, dunst, eLinks, and Conky piped into i3bar.
But font awesome has changed its glyph code now. Probably the icons will break.  <br />
**Now Playing** : Dream Theater - Strange Deja Vu <br /> <br />

## i3 : Vacant
![preview-i3-pywal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-i3-pywal.jpg) <br />
**Stuff in the screenshot** : Ncmpcpp inside Urxvt, mpdviz visualizer, dmenu2 (not a normal dmenu), and Lemonbar <br />
**Now Playing** : Dream Theater - Vacant <br />
My current i3 setup on Debian. Vanilla i3, too lazy too build i3-gaps. I place this configuration on *~/.config/i3-pywal*.
If You want to use it, just copy every content in this folder to *~/.config/i3*. And everything is *pywaled*.
So, You need to install pywal first. <br /> <br />
